      <description>Abstract: A fully decentralised, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral tech stack would provide the necessary support for self-sovereign virtual territories. Recent breakthroughs in distributed systems, leaderless consensus algorithms, and ZK encryption provide the technical foundation that makes such a base layer possible. By using these technologies to build solutions for communications, storage, and smart contracts, we can incentivise the formation of borderless public institutions based on voluntary consent. This opens the possibility for a culture of resilient parallel societies that maximise the costs of surveillance and coercion, while minimising the costs of exit, voice, and loyalty. Doing this requires a resilient grassroots movement to govern and sustain the network, thereby providing trust-minimised, corruption-resistant governing services and social institutions to underserved citizens.</description>
